If you want to extract presence conditions for files from the
latest version each get and compile KBuildMiner

otherwise simply copy the pc.txt file to the ```gitbusybox``` directory
and proceed with normal preparation.


Using KBuildMiner

install Maven (mvn)

get KBuildMiner from 
http://code.google.com/p/variability/source/browse/KBuildMiner/

run ```mvn package```

the actual tool is invoked then from ```prepareGit.sh```
